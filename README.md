# Bracelet 101
![alt tag](https://github.com/ValkA/BraceletIOT/raw/master/image1.jpg)

This is the repository of "Bracelet 101", a POC of smart bracelet for Medical Corps that is attached to an injured person in order to record medical events (i.e injection of morphine, wearing a tourniquet etc...).

The bracelet uses NFC to register events in the field and Bluetooth to communicate later with an Android device that is held by a doctor at hospital or at the battalion aid station.

Each medical treatment has an NFC tag with the id of the treatment and should be registered in the bracelet by holding it near the bracelet before giving the treatment to the injured person.

## Bluetooth protocol:
The bracelet reads commands via Bluetooth serial in the format <$type,$data>.

After receiving a command, the bracelet sends '#' as an ack. If there wasn't enough memory to add a record, __the bracelet will send '!' back__, instead of '#'.

The following types can be sent to the bracelet:

- <0,Integer> adds a tag scan. In case the doctor wants to add a treatment manually through the phone.
$data is the treatment number.

- <2,Integer> - adds new data (such as temperature measurement by doctor).

- <3,$time,$tsid,Integer> - update record [$time,$tsid] with new data (Integer 14bit max)

- <4,Integer> - adds a record of headquarters communication (such as evacuation notification),
$data can be any kind of Integer.

- <5,Integer> - adds a record of blood pressure.
$data = blood pressure

- <6,Integer> - Turns on buzzer,
$data has no meaning, but should be some kind of Integer. 0 can be put there.

- <7,$time,$tsid,0> - delete record represented by $time,$tsid.

- <8,Integer> - adds soldierID record. $data should contain the soldier's personal number.

- <13,Integer> - adds soldier status (severity of injury).
$data is id of the status.


For example, the command <1,123> will add a record into the bracelet that represents a new connection by a phone that is represented by the number 123. As a response you will get the database.

#### Special commands:

- LOCATION:
To register location you should send <10,(double/float)latitude><11,(double/float)longitude>
you will see the location when you will send <1,doctor_id>. the location will be among the tags in the container.
for example, [<1,3,0,1><10,32.2343><11,7.23456>]. fields 2 and 3 represent the latitude and longitude.

- SYNC:
<14,Integer> - a special record that can be used to keep the Android and the bracelet in sync.
When the bracelet receives this record, it sends the entire database back, but __does not place this record in it's database__.
The format of the database is the same as in <1, Integer>.
This allows this record to be sent periodically from Android to the bracelet to make sure they are both in sync (for example, every 30 seconds).
Similar to <6, Integer> the $data here has no meaning, but should be some kind of Integer.

- DOCTOR CONNECTION:
<1,Integer> on connection this is the first thing should be sent to the bracelet.
$data represents a unique number of the phone.
As an acknowledgement the bracelet will send back its database with the following format:
[<$type,$time,$tsid,$data>, <$type,$time,$tsid,$data>, ..., <$type,$time,$tsid,$data>]
also the format <3,$time,$tsid,$pointer_time,$pointer_tsid,$data> may be in the container,
which represents an update record (that was added with <3,$time,$tsid,Integer> message from doctor)
(records can be tags, app_data or any other things as defined in this doc https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-qHOoyWK5xLiwJvJ40AK0ONJ1xDmyQk-YbECwnUxzqk/edit)

## NFC Protocol (Tag format):
The tags scanned by the bracelet must be in one of the following 2 formats:
- Integer String

For example: 50 Optalgin 10mg

This format is used for different treatments. It's supposed to be in an NFC tag attached to the treatment item, to be scanned by the bracelet.

- dInteger String

For example: d1234567 Israel Israeli

This format is for the soldier personal number. It's supposed to be in an NFC tag attached to the soldier's tag (diskit).

Notice that in both cases __only the number is scanned by the bracelet__. The following string is completely ignored. It is there __optionally__ so that it could be used in other devices.

The Integer must be smaller than 2^28, which is the maximum number that can be saved in the bracelet (28 bits are stored for each record's data).

## Debugging:
It is possible to send debugging commands to the Arduino through the Serial (physical connection to the PC). There are currently 3 types of debugging commands:
- d - print the current database to the Serial.
- m - print memory information to the Serial (number of records currently stored)
- <$type,$data> - add a specific record to the Arduino. The record would be parsed in the exact same manner as a record sent to the Arduino from Bluetooth. If the record is not recognized as one of the above legal records, you'll get an error and the record would not be added.

The Arduino also sends debugging information to the Serial during normal operation, such as detailed error messages. Therefore, if you encounter unexpected behaviour when interfacing through Bluetooth, connect the Arduino through the serial to see detailed debug messages.

## Wiring:

## IDE:
Don't forget to include libraries from "Libraries for IDE" folder

## Sounds and LEDs
You can change the buzzer sound or leds light with Bluetooth terminal.
The notes are configured for different cases and you can change configuration for any type separately. The types are:
  TurnOnSuccess = 0,
  TurnOnFailed = 1,
  ScanningSuccess = 2,  
  ScanningFailed = 3,
  ConnectingSuccess = 4,
	NewAppMessage = 5,
	BeepFromApp = 6,
	UnknownTag = 7

The command should starts with '[' and ends with ']'.
For change sound insert:
[0, type, frequency, freqParam , delay,  repeats]

*"type" between 0-7 as explained above.

For example:
[0,2,31,50,200,6] - will change the sound for ScanningSuccess.

For change led i insert: (i={1,2})
[i, type, delayOn,  delayOff,  repeats]

*Delay is in ms.

For example:
[0,2,500,500, 3] - will change the first/second led blinks for ScanningSuccess.
